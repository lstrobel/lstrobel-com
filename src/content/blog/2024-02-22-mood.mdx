Over just the last couple of days, my sense of nervousness and anticipation has transformed itself into focused calm. I think it's like the same feeling one gets before any big moment: a build-up of anticipation until it's finally "go time". These feelings have prompted some speculation as to what my mood will be during my trip, and, more importantly, what I *want* my mood to be.

I've always thought that my mood and my energy levels have a causal relationship. When I'm feeling particularly energetic I find it easier to be optimistic and to work towards goals that make me feel better about myself. And when I'm traveling, I find energy in abundance! But I cannot be energetic every hour of every day. It's led me to wonder about the sustainability of always chasing that high of excitement and novelty. Will I ever find contentment in the routine, in the familiar surroundings of what I already know? 

This tripâ€™s energy is something I want to harness for more than just the thrill of exploring new places. I see it as a chance to practice being okay with less exciting days. One of the things I'll practice is setting a mood goal each morning; during the day I will try to be intentional about my thoughts and actions in order to achieve that goal. The idea is that this habit will help me maintain agency over my mood even on days when I lack energy. Essentially, I'm using the trip as a catalyst to get this practice in.

This should be the last post before I start sharing updates on my actual travel! Stay tuned for less flowery introspection, and more travel fun :)
