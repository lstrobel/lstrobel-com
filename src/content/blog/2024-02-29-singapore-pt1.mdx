I'm in Singapore!! It took me about 20 hours to get here in total. The trip started with a 10 hour flight to Tokyo on ANA. The flight was actually pretty empty, I had the whole row to myself! And I gotta say, the ANA in-flight service was really great.

*Goodbye Seattle!*

After that, there was a 4-hour layover in Tokyo. I was super tired and took a nap while waiting for the flight. Finally, the 6 hour flight to Singapore. I slept for most of it, but caught some cool sights on the way in!

I arrived in Singapore at 7 am - which meant I had to stay awake another 12 hours if I didn't want to be the victim of even-worse jet lag. This was officially day 1! My first tourist destination was the Jewel mall. Unfortunately, everything was closed because it was so early. I also spent an hour trying to get my SIM card working (that was not super fun to do while tired).

Afterwards, I headed into the city center.

*Some inspiring Singaporean architecture. Love that the dreadful corporate skyscrapers at least have some green!*

I checked into my hostel later that day. I ended up falling asleep at 8pm (not bad) and sleeping for 12 hours (expected tbh). The next day, I did some more exploring.

So: what's the verdict so far? As a place to visit, I would say Singapore ranks pretty good. I love the diversity of the place: it is a vibrant melting pot of cultures, and you can find so many good food places to explore them all. 

But you can tell Singapore is a planned city (which it is), and the areas dominated by corporate architecture feel inauthentic - even if they are crazy beautiful buildings. Where I think Singapore really shines is as a potential place to live! You can definitely enjoy a nice quality of life here, with access to all the staples of high-GDP living. And you will never run out of food to try :).
